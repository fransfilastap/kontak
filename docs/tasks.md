# Kontak Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the Kontak project. Tasks are logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

### Configuration Management
[ ] Implement proper configuration validation in config.go
[ ] Add support for configuration files (JSON/YAML) in addition to environment variables
[ ] Create separate development and production configuration profiles
[ ] Move hardcoded values (like the 5-second timeout in webhook_handler.go) to configuration

### Error Handling
[ ] Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the codebase
[ ] Create custom error types for different categories of errors
[ ] Add error logging with appropriate log levels
[ ] Improve error messages to be more descriptive and actionable

### Testing
[ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
[ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
[ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
[ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Security
[ ] Implement proper input validation for all API endpoints
[ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
[ ] Implement proper password policies (minimum length, complexity)
[ ] Add CSRF protection for web endpoints
[ ] Implement secure headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
[ ] Review and secure JWT implementation

### Documentation
[ ] Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
[ ] Add code documentation for public functions and methods
[ ] Create developer setup guide
[ ] Document database schema and relationships
